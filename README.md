# React/Flux/Bootstrap boilerplate

#### This boilerplate includes skeleton for fast React/Flux/Bootstrap apps prototyping with further deployment to gh-pages. 

### Getting Started
Run `yarn install` or `npm-install` to install dependencies necessary to run the code. Run `gulp build` to bundle code into `dist` folder, or `gulp` to watch changes in `src` being bundled to `dist` dynamically. Then you can open `index.html` from `dist` in your browser of choice.

### Deployment to gh-pages
Fill the `homepage` field in `package.json` with your data instead of square braces: `https://[github user name].github.io/[repository name]`. Run `yarn deploy` or `npm run deploy`.
